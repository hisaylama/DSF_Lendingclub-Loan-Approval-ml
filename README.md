This repository contains the development of predictive models for the Lending Club platform. The primary aim is to determine whether loan applications should be approved or rejected based on various financial indicators.  In this project we predict default likelihood for loan applicants and rate them with the score.

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to enhance decision-making for loan approvals using data-driven insights. By applying machine learning models, we aim to:
- Deploy a real-time scoring model that can provide instant financial decisions - "Approve or reject loan application"
  
- Implications
    - Minimize the risk of default.
    - Reduce operational costs by automating the decision-making process.

## Real-time Scoring Application
The project investigates the development of a real-time scoring application that classifies loan applicants with a binary label—either 0 or 1—based on predictions from our machine learning model. 

In addition to this classification, each applicant is assigned a score (between 0 to 100) that reflects the probability of successful loan repayment.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download all the files.
2. Follow the [`Technical_Report.ipynb`](https://github.com/hisaylama/DSF_Lendingclub-Loan-Approval-ml/blob/main/Technical_Report.ipynb)


## Usage

Each notebook is self-contained and includes comments explaining the purpose of each section of code. Follow the notebooks in the order they are listed to replicate the analysis, model development and predictive analysis.

## Acknowledgments

- Thanks to all Elvtr and teams who have invested their efforts in develop this learning program.

**Note**: This code will soon be integrated with a front-end API for an improved user interface. 
Stay tuned for updates.
